# Ceven Jupiter Knowles

**AI Workflow Designer · Prompt Engineering · Systems Architecture**

I design governed AI systems that convert complex cognitive processes into reliable, auditable, and repeatable structures.  
My work focuses on prompt engineering, LLM operations, documentation governance, and AI-enabled workflow design for real-world environments.
